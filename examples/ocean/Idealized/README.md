# Idealized Ocean Basin

This is a simple setup without geometry and with only wind forcing from data.
Salinity and Temperature forcing are constructed synthetically (idealized).
The example starts from no forcing and increases the forcing in all three parameters
step-wise to 1 ("Combined Forcing").

The main purpose of this example is testing and developing solvers.
